## Description

The main idea of this application is created a complete chat which login and auth system, without use of strongest back-end, but which we could understand the concepts as NextAuth, Socket.io, and how work back-end in Next.js and how we could applying this in a application.

In the path <a href="https://github.com/lejoaoconte/chat-app-complete/tree/main/src/pages/api">src/pages/api</a> have the back-end part of system, which involve just two files, one on path auth which as the name said it`s the authentication part and the socket.io which is the stream part. All authentication was made with GoogleProvider of NextAuth providers.

Finally in the front-end we treat the authentication with getServerSideProps function native of Next and the stream chat with Socket.io-client.

The idea in here its to train to posibles future ideas which involves this concepts and maybe use this code in the future.
